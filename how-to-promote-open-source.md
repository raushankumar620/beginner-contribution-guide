# 🌟 How to Promote an Open Source Project

Open Source is not just about writing code — it’s about building a **community** and **spreading awareness**. Many amazing projects remain unnoticed simply because they are not promoted well.

In this guide, we’ll learn simple yet effective ways to **promote an open-source project** and help it reach a wider audience.
